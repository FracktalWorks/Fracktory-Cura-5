           Hi ðŸ‘‹, 
           We are cleaning our list of issues to improve our focus. 
           This feature request seems to be older than a year, which is at least three major Cura releases ago. 
           It also received the label Deferred indicating that we did not have time to work on it back then and haven't found time to work on it since. 
           
           If this is still something that you think can improve how you and others use Cura, can you please leave a comment? 
           We will have a fresh set of eyes to look at it. 

           If it has been resolved or don't need it to be improved anymore, you don't have to do anything, and this issue will be automatically closed in 14 days.
