Installation
------------

The GPL version of PyQt6-NetworkAuth can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install PyQt6-NetworkAuth

``pip`` will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but
Qt's ``qmake`` tool must be on ``PATH``.

The ``sip-install`` tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package
but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
